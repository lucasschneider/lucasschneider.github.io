  <dd>The MPL Koha Patch is a WebExtension build for Firefox and Google Chrome which augments the display of LibLime Koha to make various tasks more convenient for library staff. While it is developed for use by member libraries of Wisconsinâ€™s South Central Library System, it is not supported by SCLS, but is an independent project by a Library Page at Madison Central Library.</dd>
